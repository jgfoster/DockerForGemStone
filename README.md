# Docker for GemStone
This repository contains a framework and scripts to create a [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) image for [GemStone/S 64 Bit](https://gemtalksystems.com/products/gs64/) [Community Editionâ€”Starter](https://gemtalksystems.com/licensing/) (see the GemStone [license](https://downloads.gemtalksystems.com/pub/GemStone_License_Agreement.pdf)). 

Note that this is configured for a maximum database of 8 GB and does *partial logging* with *no backups*, so while it might be useful for development, it should be treated primarily as a proof-of-concept to show that GemStone can be run in Docker.
